I developed this Google Script when I was working as Player Support Shift Lead. 

When a ticket was hitting the 24h with no response, it was automatically going out of SLA (Service Level Agreement) and PS Agents were told to prioritize these tickets. When I joined the project, Team Leads were spending hours in order to manually grab these tickets. 

This Google Script was automatically completing the task of selecting the out of SLA tickets so Team Leads didn't have to spend that precious time any more. 

A guide will be recorded and provided by me as soon as possible.
