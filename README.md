I developed this Google Script when I was working as Player Support Shift Lead.<br />

When a ticket was hitting 24h with no response, it was automatically going out of SLA (Service Level Agreement) and Player Support Agents were told to prioritize these tickets. When I joined the project, Team Leads were spending hours in order to manually grab these tickets. This Google Script was automatically completing the task of selecting the out of SLA tickets so that the Team Leads didn't have to spend that precious time any more. <br />

As a side note, near SLA tickets were gathered too, as well as the amount of tickets per queue.<br />

In order to make it easier for you, I have included a template in the project's folder. Feel free to grab it and work from there. As soon as the template is imported to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Sheets</a>, you will have to create a button on the Sheet called <code>Instructions</code>. That button will have to be linked to the Script called <code>ps_sf_queue_checks</code>.<br />

Some tickets were added to the Spreadsheet so that you can go ahead and run the Script right away.
